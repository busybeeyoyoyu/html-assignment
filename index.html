    <h2><strong>About me </strong></h2>
    <article> <p1>I was born in a city called Xianning,which is in Hubei province of China. It is in the central part of this country. 
    It is also where I had my earliest memories about learning.When I was about 4 or 5 years old, one day, my friend and I found a 
    quite interesting thing is that we can burn everything via a magnifying glass by reflect the sunlight.  We were so exciting, 
    so we started to burn the ants on the ground when they were working hard on carrying. This was seen by my father who happened
     to be passing by. He criticized me harshly and immediately. He asked me what I goanna feel if someone use a magnifying glass 
     to burn me? He said it important to have sympathy as a human being. From that. I understood we can learn lots of general 
     knowledge and principles from our daily life.  
      To participate in IMD program, the biggest challenge for me is that I
      don’t have any background in graphic design or web development. I got lots of confusions with the courses especially on the 
      coding class. However, I know it is normal for everyone who switched to another totally different program. On the other hand,
       I got great enthusiasm with IMD program, such as I feel exciting to learn all this new knowledge and there always comes up
     some new ideas in my mind when I am taking the class. So, I’m confident in study in IMD. </p1>
